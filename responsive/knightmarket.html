        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
        KnightMarket is a web-based marketplace platform designed exclusively for University of Central Florida students, allowing users to buy, sell, and bid items within the
        UCF community.
        </p>

        <p>
        I contributed to the front-end design of KnightMarket, focusing on a clean interface that is user friendly for all. Consistent colors and relevant images were used to
        make navigation easy on the eyes.
